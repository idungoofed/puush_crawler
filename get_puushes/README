bruteForce.c: first attempt
bruteForce_v2.c: adds possibility for filenames that are 5 characters long (original only tested for 6)

missingFile.jpg and privateFile.jpg: used for testing for empty puushes
	Respectively, file doesn't exist or you don't have authorization to view that puush

./bruteForce_results/: filenames for puushes that exist are stored in this directory
